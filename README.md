## To run
```bash
pip install qt_material geopy PyQt5
git clone https://github.com/Crilum/pyqt5-weather-app
cd pyqt5-weather-app
python3 weatherUi.py
```
You'll need a free API key from OpenWeatherMap to run this app.

Note: `weatherUi.py` must be run in the same directory as the ui files.

## How it Works

This app uses data from OpenWeatherMap to display weather data:
- For a 7-day forecast
- For the current weather

It also can display and export the raw JSON from the API.

The app features many themes and a few other fun options.
